Question #1
You have an application in which there are multiple tasks grouped in groups of four. A user can perform a task multiple times and each time their proficiency in that particular task goes up. When a user reaches 100% proficiency in all the tasks in any given group, that user gains access to the second tier of tasks for that group, and then the third, and so on. Create the necessary models to track this progress; the user should be able to see all the tasks currently available to them and only be able to complete the tasks that are available.

Report
The models are sufficient to track the progress of the user, but it's only pleasant to interact with some logic to tie it together, so I've put it in to make sure it's sufficient.
