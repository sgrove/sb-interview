 Question #1
  You have an application in which there are multiple tasks grouped in
  groups of 4. A user can perform a task multiple times and each time
  their proficiency in that particular task goes up. When a user reaches
  100% proficiency in all the tasks in any given group, that user gains
  access to the second tier of tasks for that group, and then the third,
  and so on. Create the necessary models to track this progress; the
  user should be able to see all the tasks currently available to them
  and only be able to complete the tasks that are available.
